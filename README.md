Project 1 : CALCULATOR

A simple calculator is a basic application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically features a user-friendly interface where users
can input numbers and select operations, displaying the results in real-time.
Project 2 : Stop Watch / Clock

A stopwatch/clock application combines the functions of a stopwatch and a clock. It allows users to
measure elapsed time with start, stop, and reset features, while also displaying the current time. The
interface typically shows hours, minutes, and seconds, providing a versatile tool for timing activities and
checking the time simultaneously.
